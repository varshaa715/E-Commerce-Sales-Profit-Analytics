# E-Commerce-Sales-Profit-Analytics
Project Description / Purpose
This is an interactive e-commerce sales analytics dashboard designed to track and analyze sales performance across various dimensions such as geography, product categories, payment modes, and time periods. The dashboard provides clear visual insights into sales amounts, quantities, profits, and average order values to help stakeholders monitor business health, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions for sales optimization and strategic planning.

Tech Stack

Excel / CSV – for data cleaning and preprocessing before visualization
Kaggle Dataset – primary source of e-commerce sales data

Data Source
The dataset was imported from Kaggle, containing detailed transactional sales data including amounts, quantities, profits, product categories, payment modes, and geographic states. Data was cleaned and structured in Excel before integration into Power BI for dashboard creation.
